#+SUMMARY:

Hi hi 👋 You can call me Yayoi, all of my friends do. I am 38 years old and I live on the west coast in the USA. Just over a year ago I discovered, or rather, re-discovered the MMO Fiesta Online with friends. I am now completely addicted 🤪 If being honest, Fiesta Online isn't exactly the best game in the world. Its grindy and it can be hard to solo, but I've made friends and just can't seem to leave them. So I keep playing 😅

I am typically seen running around on one of four characters, sometimes up to three at once 😵‍💫. I'll list them for you:

+ Yayoi_chi🏹 - Level 118
+ UiTamaki✝️ - Level 133
+ BabyYayo🏹 - Level 50
+ ToukaSatomi👻 - Level 81

Over the last several months I learned that the most fun I have is helping others. I often take UiTamaki out for random buff runs all over the world and just love helping friends with quests. I also have been a member of several guildes and picked up a few things from them, including some [[{{% ref guides %}}][guides]]. If you're looking for a friend, or someone to help you out, just find me in game. I'd be happy to help 😁
