        <description>Hi hi everypeep üëãüèª
Is everyone having a good and scary halloween time? Got your favorite beverages in blood bags, some good spaghetti brains, and‚Ä¶.the scariest of it all, candy corn? For me Halloween is one of my favorite times of year! One of the things a really like about Fiesta Online during this time of year is the spooky make over that comes to all the major towns. In the past years this would usually come to the game in the first or second update of October.</description>

        <description>Hi hi everypeep üëãüèª During my undergraduate studies I have decided to take a few extra courses to fill out some credit requirements. I took a couple of language courses including two years of Japanese. I&amp;#39;ve always liked Japan and thought studying Japanese would give me a brief introduction to the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Japan and not the one seen in anime and manga. It did do that and I thought</description>

        <description>Hello everypeep!
If any of you have visited this site before, you may have noticed a few changes. Even if you haven&amp;#39;t ever visited this site, and its quite possible since I have not done much to spread awareness of this site, I still wanted to do this little post. Its mostly for me, and a bit for testing how things will work going forward. Anyway, the important bit is that the site is now running on a different platform, or more specifically, it is now being built on another platform.</description>
